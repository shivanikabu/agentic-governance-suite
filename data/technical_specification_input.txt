AI-Powered Customer Support Chatbot with Multimodal Capabilities - Technical Specification
---
1. Introduction
This document outlines the technical specifications for the development and deployment of an AI-powered customer
support chatbot. The system is designed to handle multimodal input (text, image) and provide intelligent, context-aware
responses in real-time across various customer service scenarios.
2. Project Overview
The chatbot leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV), and Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) techniques. It supports interactions via website chat, mobile app, and social media platforms. Key use
cases include resolving customer queries, identifying issues from product images, and providing knowledge base
answers.
3. Objectives
- Automate 80% of customer service queries.
- Support multimodal inputs (text and image).
- Integrate with existing CRM and ticketing systems.
- Reduce average response time to under 2 seconds.
4. System Architecture
- Frontend: React.js-based web widget, mobile SDK.
- Backend: Python FastAPI microservices.
- Model Layer:
  - Text: OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo via API.
  - Vision: Azure Custom Vision or CLIP model.
  - RAG: LangChain + FAISS Vector DB.

- Database: PostgreSQL for structured data, Azure Blob for media.
- DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps.
5. Functional Requirements
- FR1: Accept user queries via chat interface.
- FR2: Upload and process images.
- FR3: Use RAG to retrieve relevant context.
- FR4: Generate response using AI model.
- FR5: Log interactions in CRM.
- FR6: Escalate complex cases to human agents.
6. Non-Functional Requirements
- NFR1: Response latency < 2 seconds.
- NFR2: Uptime 99.9%.
- NFR3: Scalability for 10,000+ concurrent users.
- NFR4: GDPR and CCPA compliance.
7. Data Requirements
- Historical chat logs for fine-tuning.
- Product manuals and documentation.
- Annotated image dataset (faulty vs. normal).
- Customer profiles and ticket metadata.
8. Model Specifications
- Text Model: GPT-4 Turbo (OpenAI API).
- Vision Model: OpenAI GPT-4V or CLIP, with fine-tuned layers.

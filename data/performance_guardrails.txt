## Introduction

Agentic AI systems—those that take autonomous actions on behalf of users—require robust guardrails to ensure they operate safely, effectively, and ethically. This document provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating and monitoring the performance of agentic AI architectures across five critical dimensions:

1. **Hallucination prevention**: Ensuring factual accuracy and preventing fabricated information
2. **Bias detection and mitigation**: Identifying and reducing algorithmic prejudices
3. **Explanability and transparency**: Making AI reasoning processes understandable to users
4. **Resource linking quality**: Providing relevant, high-quality external references
5. **Action safety and appropriateness**: Ensuring AI actions align with user intent and ethical standards

This framework is designed to be adaptable to various agentic AI implementations while maintaining consistent quality standards.
